# Rick & Morty

Rick & Morty is an app created as a code challenge for Multimoney hiring process.

## Description

This app consists of a list of characters from the animated series Rick & Morty, and it shows its details view when selecting any of them.

The project has been developed in SwiftUI following the structure of the MVVM design pattern for the Main View (List of characters) and the new pattern suggested by Apple, named MV, for the elements in the characters array.

The data is obtained from a GraphQL API and this framework has been implemented via Swift Package Manager.

The images that are shown in the list and the detail view, are stored in the cache to prevent multiple downloads and improve the app's performance.

A git brach has been created for every single feature and has been merged into develop branch after the completion of the task.
